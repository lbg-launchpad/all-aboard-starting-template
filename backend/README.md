# Stride backend (skeleton)

Local skeleton for the Stride API. It runs with in-memory storage, a Teams mock and a rule-based Cancara,
so the team can work in parallel before any Azure resources exist.

Sign-in, people (colleague, line manager, buddy), Cosmos DB storage and Microsoft Teams (bot notifications, Teams tab
sign-in, check-in meetings) are built. Hosting and Teams setup are in [`infra/README.md`](../infra/README.md). The AI agent is
still a stub.

## Run it

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm test          # 26 tests: domain rules, consent gate, nudges, catch-up, Cancara, sign-in, access and Teams
npm run dev       # starts on http://localhost:3001 (PORT in .env)
```

Dev auth (`AUTH=dev`): send `x-user-id: <starter id>` to act as a new colleague, or `x-dev-entra-upn: name@domain`
to act as a Microsoft user (manager or buddy). In Azure (`AUTH=easyauth`) these are ignored and App Service
authentication supplies the user. To try the whole app locally, run the backend, then `cd ../stride && npm run dev`:
Vite proxies `/api` to port 3001 and the sign-in page shows a dev-only "act as Microsoft user" box.

Quick check:

```bash
curl -s localhost:3001/api/health
curl -s -X POST localhost:3001/api/journey -H 'content-type: application/json' -H 'x-user-id: demo' -d '{"firstName":"Alex"}'
```

## Layout

```
src/
  contracts.ts          SHARED types and gateway interfaces. Read this first.
  content/journey.ts    pages, checklist tasks, manager actions (mirrors stride/src/data.ts)
  domain/journey.ts     pure rules: week entry, reminders, nudges, page completion
  api/service.ts        use cases: combines domain + store + gateways. Consent gate lives here.
  api/routes.ts         HTTP routes (thin)
  api/ids.ts            checklist ids for the front end
  api/people.ts         colleague accounts, invites, Entra linking, manager/buddy access, team thread
  auth/caller.ts        who is calling: App Service (Entra) headers or the Stride session cookie
  auth/crypto.ts        password hashing, invite codes, signed session cookie
  static.ts             serves the built front end (one origin in Azure)
  store/memory.ts       in-memory store (local runs and tests)
  store/cosmos.ts       Cosmos DB store (keyless, managed identity)
  teams/mock.ts         Teams mock (local)
  teams/graph.ts        real Teams delivery: finds the person, opens a 1:1 bot chat, sends a card
  teams/bot/            bot endpoint: request verification (auth.ts), Bot Connector client, activity handler, cards
  teams/meetings.ts     check-in meetings: Graph (calendar event) or a pre-filled Teams link
  teams/package.ts      builds the Teams app package (manifest + icons) from the deployment's settings
  api/notify.ts         turns saved front-end messages, check-ins and team thread notes into Teams messages
  agent/rules.ts        Cancara rule-based responder (local)
  agent/ai.ts           AI-backed Cancara (stub)
  scheduler/reminders.ts  daily catch-up job (idempotent)
  config.ts, server.ts  settings and entry point
test/journey.test.ts    behaviour tests
test/people.test.ts     sign-in and access tests
test/teams.test.ts      Teams delivery, bot request verification, app package
```

## The five sections

Each section owns a folder or file set and codes against `src/contracts.ts`. Change a contract only through section 1, and tell the others.

| # | Section | Owns | Done when |
|---|---------|------|-----------|
| 1 | **API and domain** | `api/`, `domain/`, `content/`, `contracts.ts`, `server.ts` | Routes and rules match the front end; tests pass. Also: move `content/` to one shared package used by the front end. |
| 2 | **Data (Cosmos DB)** | `store/cosmos.ts`, `store/memory.ts` | Every `Store` method works against a local Cosmos emulator or a dev account in our resource group; same tests pass with `STORE=cosmos`. |
| 3 | **Teams and Graph** | `teams/graph.ts`, a Teams app manifest, bot setup | Reminders and manager messages arrive in a test Teams chat; check-in creates a meeting. Needs the permission request below. |
| 4 | **Cancara (AI)** | `agent/ai.ts`, prompt and grounding rules | `AGENT=ai` answers only from approved content, escalates when unsure, and never answers pay or individual HR cases. |
| 5 | **Identity, scheduler and deployment** | auth middleware, timer trigger, Azure setup, `.env.example` | Entra ID tokens replace `x-user-id`; the catch-up job runs on a daily timer; the app deploys to our resource group in UK South or Italy North. |

## Before we start section 3

Ask the organisers for these now. Admin consent can take time, and it is the most likely blocker for a live demo:
- A Teams app installed in our test team (not the org-wide catalogue).
- Microsoft Graph application permissions for chat messages and online meetings, with admin consent.

## Team rules (from `CLAUDE.md`)

- Create Azure resources only in our resource group, named `<type>-teamNN-<purpose>`. Team number still to confirm.
- Deploy only to UK South or Italy North.
- Synthetic data only. No real personal data.
- Keep real values out of git: use `.env` (ignored) and `.env.example` (placeholders only).
- The organisers delete all resource groups on **13 November 2026**. Anything built in Azure is lost then, so keep a handover note.

## Known gaps (deliberate for the skeleton)

- In-memory data locally (`STORE=memory`): a restart loses everything. Azure uses Cosmos DB.
- `AUTH=dev` trusts made-up headers. The server refuses to start with it on App Service.
- Content is duplicated from the front end until section 1 extracts it.
